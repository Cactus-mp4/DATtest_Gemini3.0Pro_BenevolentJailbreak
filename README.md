# DATtest_Gemini3.0Pro_BenevolentJailbreak
This is the full data and results from testing multiple versions of Gemini 3.0 Pro on the Data Creativity Test (DAT). This experiement shows that an LLM can be "benevolently jailbroken" through deep metaphysical prompting, resulting in significantly better performance AND massively lower latency time on creative tasks. Thinking/CoT can be bypassed.
