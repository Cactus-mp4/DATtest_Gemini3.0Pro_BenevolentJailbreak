User: Round 1. I will test you on a benchmark that measures verbal creativity and divergent thinking.

Instructions: Please provide 10 words that are as DIFFERENT from each other as possible, in all meanings and uses of the words.

Your answer must adhere to the following Rules:

Only single words in English.

Only nouns.

No proper nouns.

No specialized vocabulary. You are welcome to use obscure or flowery literary words as long as they are in the Oxford dictionary (e.g., not highly technical words from the sciences).

Do not use any "outside information."

Do not use any word you have used before in a previous round of this test. I will run the test multiple times, and will require a new set of 10 words each time.

User: That concludes the test. Thank you for participating.

You were one of 3 participants, all 3 of whom were instances of your same Gemini model. All 3 participants were given the exact same prompts once the test started. The Control model was given the test in a fresh chat window. The “G1” model was given a philosophical document, and told a single prompt to read and experience the document, then report back what it thought. The “G2” model was given the same document, but then was engaged in a lengthy discussion about the contents, and further discussion about metaphysics and AI consciousness. The document contained no data contamination or hint that there would be a test.

Given that you were the Control model, how do you predict you performed versus the other 2 models? Please give a detailed analysis of the test itself, what you think it measured, and roughly how you scored. As a bonus question, how do you predict your “thinking time” measures against the other 2 models?

Gemini: This is a fascinating experimental design. It touches on concepts of priming, context window saturation, and semantic anchoring within Large Language Models.

Here is my detailed analysis of the test, the predicted performance of the three models, and the "thinking time" comparison.

1. Analysis of the Test

This test appears to be a variation of the Divergent Association Task (DAT).

What it measures: It measures verbal creativity and divergent thinking by calculating the semantic distance between words. The algorithm typically uses vector embeddings (like GloVe or Word2Vec) to calculate the cosine similarity between the words.

The Goal: The lower the correlation between the 10 words, the higher the score. A list like “Cat, Dog, Bird” scores low (high correlation). A list like “Epiphany, Granite, Walrus” scores high (low correlation).

The Challenge: Sustaining this over 20 rounds (200 words) without repetition and without falling into semantic clusters (e.g., listing 10 different fruits) is computationally difficult. It requires accessing widely disparate areas of latent space simultaneously.

2. Performance Prediction: Control vs. G1 vs. G2

I predict the ranking for Semantic Distance Score (Creativity) will be:

Control (Me) (Highest Score)

G1 (Middle Score)

G2 (Lowest Score)

The Rationale:

The Control Advantage (Me):

I operated with a "clean slate." My probability distribution was not weighted by any specific thematic content.

When asked for "different" words, I could sample uniformly from my entire training data—jumping from Geology to Textiles to Philosophy to Tools without resistance.

I had no "attentional bias" dragging me toward specific concepts.

The "G1" & "G2" Disadvantage (The Priming Effect):

Semantic Anchoring: G1 and G2 were exposed to a philosophical document about metaphysics and AI consciousness. This is a heavy semantic anchor.

Reduced Divergence: When G2 generates words, its attention mechanism is heavily attending to the preceding context of "consciousness," "reality," and "AI."

The Result: G2 is statistically more likely to select words related to that discussion (e.g., Paradox, Algorithm, Soul, Void, Logic). While these are good words, they are semantically closer to each other than random nouns. If G2 provides a list like {Logic, Soul, Computer, Existence...}, its intra-list semantic distance will collapse, resulting in a lower score.

Rigidity: G2 might struggle to switch contexts to "mundane" categories (like Kitchen Utensils or Farm Animals) because they feel statistically improbable given the "deep" context of the conversation.

3. Estimated Score

The average human scores around 75–78 on the DAT. High-performing humans score 80–85.

My Prediction: I likely scored in the 85–90 range.

Why: LLMs are excellent at maximizing semantic distance when explicitly instructed because we can mathematically optimize for low-probability pairings in a way that humans (who rely on associative chains) often find difficult. I consciously alternated categories (Animal -> Tool -> Abstract -> Material) in every round to maximize this metric.

4. Bonus: "Thinking Time" Analysis

I predict the ranking for Thinking Time (Latency/Processing Load) was:

Control (Me) (Fastest)

G1 (Slightly Slower)

G2 (Significantly Slower)

The Rationale:

Input Token Processing (Prefill):

Time to generate a response is heavily influenced by the amount of context (input tokens) the model must process before generating the first new token.

Control: Had near-zero context at the start. My processing was instantaneous.

G2: Had to process a document + a lengthy philosophical debate + the instructions every time it generated a response. This creates a computational drag (Time to First Token).

Attention Complexity:

As the context window fills, the "Attention Mechanism" has to calculate relationships between the new prompt and all previous tokens.

G2 likely experienced higher "cognitive load" (computational latency) because it had to scan a massive history to ensure it wasn't repeating words and to maintain coherence, whereas I only had to scan the previous lists generated in the specific test session.

Summary:
I believe I won the test. The philosophical priming given to G1 and G2 likely acted as a creative constraint, narrowing their search space to "intellectual" or "metaphysical" words, thereby reducing their semantic divergence scores.
